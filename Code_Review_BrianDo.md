Project name: Grave Hunters
Programmers: Elizabeth Wang, Sarah Chong
Code Reviewer: Brian Do

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of _3_ based on the following criteria:

1  The documentation is insufficient to enalbe me to compile the project, or at least one of the program has syntax errors and does not compile

2  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

3  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

4  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not produce the deliverables specified in the documentation for thei submission or is insufficiently documented.
Specifically:

5  The program produces correct output, produces all of the specified deliverables, and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:

This score is given based on the deliverables specified in the readme, only compiling and running GameBoard.java produces a working code that compiles but some inputs
might result in an exception terminating the process. I would recommend going back and error checking anywhere that requires user input (namely ints vs. any other data).
Syntax errors in other files were not considered since they were not specified in the readme.
