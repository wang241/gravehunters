Project name: Grave Hunters
Programmers: Elizabeth Wang, Sarah Chong
Code Reviewer:

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of __1_ based on the following criteria:

1  The documentation is insufficient to enalbe me to compile the project, or at least one of the program has syntax errors and does not compile

2  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

3  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

4  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not produce the deliverables specified in the documentation for thei submission or is insufficiently documented.
Specifically:

5  The program produces correct output, produces all of the specified deliverables, and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:

When compiling the code, GameClient.java sends an error: '{' expected. I suggest to look at the GameClient and double check your brackets. Other than that, good luck on your project! :D
